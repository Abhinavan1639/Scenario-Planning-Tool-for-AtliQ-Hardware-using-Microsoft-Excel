Overview:
The purpose of this project is to develop a scenario planning tool using Microsoft Excel for AtliQ Hardware, a customer of Croma. The tool will enable AtliQ Hardware to analyze and forecast sales performance under different scenarios and evaluate their financial impact on the company. By providing insights into best-case, realistic, and worst-case scenarios, the tool will help AtliQ Hardware make informed business decisions and set appropriate targets.

Key Features:

1. Scenario Inputs: The tool will allow users to input various parameters such as discount percentage, cost of goods sold (COGS), average net invoice price (NIP), and gross margin (GM) target. These inputs will be used to calculate sales figures and financial metrics for different scenarios.

2. Scenario Analysis: The tool will generate sales projections based on the user-defined parameters for best-case, realistic, and worst-case scenarios. It will calculate net invoice sales, post-discount sales, net sales, COGS, and gross margin for each scenario.

3. Financial Comparison: The tool will provide a clear comparison between the actual sales performance and the target gross margin. It will highlight the variance in gross margin achieved for each scenario, allowing AtliQ Hardware to assess its performance against the set targets.

4. Data Visualization: The tool will include visual charts and graphs to present the sales and financial data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner. This will enable stakeholders at AtliQ Hardware to quickly grasp the differences between scenarios and identify trends or patterns.

5. Sensitivity Analysis: The tool will allow users to perform sensitivity analysis by modifying the input parameters and observing their impact on sales and gross margin. This feature will help AtliQ Hardware assess the sensitivity of their financial performance to changes in key variables.

Benefits:

1. Improved Decision Making: By using the scenario planning tool, AtliQ Hardware can make more informed business decisions. The ability to assess the potential outcomes under different scenarios will enable the company to identify risks, opportunities, and necessary adjustments to achieve their financial goals.

2. Target Setting: The tool will assist AtliQ Hardware in setting realistic and achievable gross margin targets based on the defined parameters. It will provide insights into the expected gross margin for different sales volumes, helping the company establish realistic performance expectations.

3. Enhanced Financial Analysis: The tool will provide comprehensive financial analysis by automatically calculating key sales and margin metrics. AtliQ Hardware can easily compare actual performance with different scenarios, enabling them to identify areas of improvement and take proactive measures to optimize profitability.

4. Efficient Resource Allocation: With the scenario planning tool, AtliQ Hardware can allocate resources effectively based on projected sales volumes. It will help in managing inventory, production capacity, and overall operational planning to align with the forecasted demand under different scenarios.

5. Adaptability: The tool will be developed using Microsoft Excel, a widely-used software, making it easy to understand and use for employees at AtliQ Hardware. Additionally, the tool can be customized and expanded in the future to incorporate additional features or adapt to changing business requirements.

In conclusion, the scenario planning tool for AtliQ Hardware using Microsoft Excel will provide valuable insights and analysis for sales forecasting and financial planning. It will empower AtliQ Hardware to make data-driven decisions, set realistic targets, and optimize their financial performance in a dynamic and competitive market.
